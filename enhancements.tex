\section{Ideas for enhancements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Decouple data structure providers (classes that provide a common interface for
			our needs and use specific data structures, but hide this from the outside) and their
			clients (classes for the whole graph, for nodes, and for edges)
		\item Implement more data structure providers which have not yet been present, but could
			be interesting for different reasons (faster run time, less memory consumption,\ldots)
		\item Create a recommender system which analyses a whole workflow consisting of graph
			generation, batch generation and application, metric application,\ldots over multiple
			runs of a series, computes the complexity of the accesses that happened, and gives
			recommendations about better data structures to use for this collection of accesses
