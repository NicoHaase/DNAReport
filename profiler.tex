\section{Profiling}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Question: different data structures have different complexities. Adding something
			might be cheap on one, but extensive on another that is faster on removing them. But
			how can we compare them based on the accesses used?
		\item Idea: count each call to the data structures, compute the complexities at the
			end and give recommendations
		\item Achieved through AspectJ which can be used to add functionalities using completely
			seperate files that are woven into the existing code on compile time. This enables us
			to keep nearly all profiler functionality seperated from the other code
		\item On runtime, the profiler counts calls based on the performed action (add, remove,
			contains) and callee signature (metric name, update type,\ldots), such that we can
			determine the complexities for different use cases with one execution
